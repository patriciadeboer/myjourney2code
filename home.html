			<h3>Hey Everyone! I'm Patricia. </h3>
			<p>I am taking the #100DaysOfCode Challenge. I built this site to use as a space to be able to practice and apply the different skills I learn throughout myJourney2Code.
			<h4> Start Date: November 30, 2018 </h4>
			<h4> End Date: March 9, 2019  </h4>

			<a href="projects/library.html"><h2>The Projects</h2></a>
			<p>Along side taking online courses as well as doing practice admissions problems, my goal is to complete small projects to work on my HTML, CSS, and JS skills. These can be any random project ideas anywhere from recreating Hangman to building a simple To Do list and any other random ideas I either come across or come up with. My goal is to do some sort of coding daily, but not necessarily daily projects. A project can take more than one day to complete</p>
			<p> My hope is that over the course of the #100DaysOfCode (and beyond) to build more complex projects over the course of time and share them all here. I plan to document my experience as I build the different projects, and document any hurdles, issues, or key learnings I come across. </p>
			<h4 class="ulheader"> Current Favorite Projects:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Create Your Own Mondrain</li>
				<li>Hangman</li>
				<li>To Do List </li>

			<h2>The Insights</h2>
			<p>This page will be a random collection of pieces.</p>
			<p> I will share motivational quotes (like the one you see pictured on this page) that are helping me get through the challenge, any resources that I've used that have helped me along the way, and any just key pointers or tutorials that I create as I work through all this coding.</p>
			<p>So essentially I will be including insights on:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Motivational Quotes &amp; Advice</li>
				<li>Resources</li>
				<li>Tutorials</li>
				<li>Cheat Sheets</li>
				<li>Any other resources I may create</li>

		<h2>Keep in mind!</h2>
		<p> This site is a work in progress. It may look different every time you visit as I make updates and changes as I learn along the way. There may even be times where I mess up things (unintentionally) so there may be bugs / issues. Please bear with me as I continue to learn and try to make improvements!</p>
