# 100 Days Of Code - Daily Log
<!--- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)

**Today's Work**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: November 30, 2018 - Friday
**Time Spent**: 2hrs

**Today's Work**: Introduction to HTML (Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy) - made a simple webpage declaring Lebron James as the GOAT with hyperlinks, images, etc.

**Thoughts**: I find it appropriate going back to the very basics to start off my 100 day coding challenge. Colt Steele's course, so far, has been amazing, because he goes beyond the coding process and explains the rationale behind some concepts like "semantic markup." Though, I personally have to focus more and eliminate distractions while doing this daily challenge. I have to make that 1 hr+ time sacred!
