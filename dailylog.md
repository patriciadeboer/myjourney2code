### Day 1: November 30, 2018 - Friday
**Time Spent**: 2hrs

**Today's Work**: Made a very basic animation. Just something to get this challenge started. I played with some formatting as well. Some of the base of the site I had started building before starting the challenge. 

**Thoughts**: Tomorrow I hope to go back and clean up some of my base code for the site, as I want to make sure things don't go out of hand quickly.
