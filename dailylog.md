### Day 1: November 30, 2018 - Friday
**Time Spent**: 2hrs

**Today's Work**: Made a very basic animation. Just something to get this challenge started. I played with some formatting as well. Some of the base of the site I had started building before starting the challenge. 

**Thoughts**: Tomorrow I hope to go back and clean up some of my base code for the site, as I want to make sure things don't go out of hand quickly.

### Day 2: December 1, 2018 - Friday
**Time Spent**: 1.5 hrs

**Today's Work**: Today I just focused on doing a few practice exercises and watch Fullstack Bootcamp prep videos. I got through all the Object videos on the Bootcamp prep course, and went through about 4 coderbyte challenges. Came across some hurdles, but overall making progress. I did the following challenges: 
-Array Addition I
-Second GreatLow
-Word Count
-Prime Time
-Number Addition

**Thoughts**: Learned some useful new methods. One that I learned to use and that saved me a lot of time was match(). In the number addition problem, you had to search for the numbers within a string. var nums = str.match(/[0-9]+/gi) || [0]; I returns all the matches in an array. By adding the '+' you say combine any consecutive matches in one value within the array. So 89forever3yours. It would return [89,3]. Can be very useful to remember!
