# 100 Days Of Code - Daily Log
<!--- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)

**Today's Work**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: November 30, 2018 - Friday
**Time Spent**: 2hrs

**Today's Work**: Made a very basic animation. Just something to get this challenge started. I played with some formatting as well. Some of the base of the site I had started building before starting the challenge. 

**Thoughts**: Tomorrow I hope to go back and clean up some of my base code for the site, as I want to make sure things don't go out of hand quickly.
