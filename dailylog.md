### Day 1: November 30, 2018 - Friday
**Time Spent**: 2hrs

**Today's Work**: Made a very basic animation. Just something to get this challenge started. I played with some formatting as well. Some of the base of the site I had started building before starting the challenge. 

**Thoughts**: Tomorrow I hope to go back and clean up some of my base code for the site, as I want to make sure things don't go out of hand quickly.

### Day 2: December 1, 2018 - Saturday
**Time Spent**: 1.5 hrs

**Today's Work**: Today I just focused on doing a few practice exercises and watch Fullstack Bootcamp prep videos. I got through all the Object videos on the Bootcamp prep course, and went through about 5 coderbyte challenges. Came across some hurdles, but overall making progress. I did the following challenges: 
+  Array Addition I
+  Second GreatLow
+  Word Count
+  Prime Time
+  Number Addition

**Thoughts**: Learned some useful new methods. One that I learned to use and that saved me a lot of time was match(). In the number addition problem, you had to search for the numbers within a string. var nums = str.match(/[0-9]+/gi) || [0]; I returns all the matches in an array. By adding the '+' you say combine any consecutive matches in one value within the array. So 89forever3yours. It would return [89,3]. Can be very useful to remember!

1. Project: No project on the site today. Hopefully tomorrow!
2. Entry: As there was no project, no online entry either (besides this update).

### Day 3: December 2, 2018 - Sunday
**Time Spent**: 2 hours

**Today's Work**:  
1. Practice Problems on Coderbyte:
  + Alphabet Searching _(12 mins)_
  + Changing Sequence _(11 mins)_
2. Did some work and reading on FreeCodeCamp
3. Reviewed Coderbyte: Prepare for Fullstack Application pages

**Thoughts**: Remember check what you are returning in your function. Sounds silly, but a few times I had the whole code right, just wrong output in the return. Use console.log to check. Always check. Made a list of key methods worth remembering. Just used MDN and copied it into a table along with examples to show how the method works with actual values.

### Day 5: December 4, 2018 - Tuesday
**Time Spent**: 2

**Today's Work**:  
1. Practice Problems on Coderbyte:
  + not today
2. Project - Style my Page - set up some buttons and text Input box to allow the user to style some of the elements on the page.

**Thoughts**: Forced me to revisit some old notes and projects from my time at Starter League to remember how to use triggers like on click to connect html to JS to css. It was a good refresher. This was a simple yet valuable way to make the connections.

### Day 6: December 5, 2018 - Wednesday
**Time Spent**: 4 hours

**Today's Work**:  
1. Practice Problems on Coderbyte:
  + None yet
2. Project - Hangman. I created a basic version of hangman on my site today. It picks from a list of 100 random words and takes input from the user to see if it's a match. The user has 6 wrong attempts before their chances are up. If you want to try to play, check out the project link below. 

**Thoughts**: Realize I need to think more about the structure of my site and the importance of organization. I may want to use of my days this week to try to clean up the site some, streamline the code, and make the site mobile friendly before I get too far in. 
Did help me to do a lot of JS + HTML stuff today. Remembering how the functions in javascript can help make the HTML and CSS more interactive and dynamic. It was fun, yet frustrating at times. Check on the project for yourself!

### Day 7: December 6, 2018 - Thursday
**Time Spent**: 1 hour

**Today's Work**:  
1. Project- finalized further edits to mobile friendly nav bar. Unfortunately didn't have as much time today, so was limited to just this progress. Made some other minor edits, and orgnaizational changes on the site.

**Thoughts**: Comment out different lines in code slowly and one at a time to help understand what and why things aren't working as expected or how the page reacts to the changes. Also trying to limit # of css files is great, but can be dangerous if your naming is too generic. Need to learn better practices for this in future.

1. Just my site in general: https://patriciadeboer.github.io/myjourney2code (no specific project today)

### Day 10: December 9, 2018 - Sunday
**Time Spent**: 2 hours

**Today's Work**:  
1. Bootcamp Prep - finished up section on Higher Order functions
2. Project - TicTacToe

**Thoughts**: Used Higher Order functions in my code today. I've used it before; however, after watching the videos, helped me understand more on the right way and how values are passed properly. 
Learning to break down the problem into multiple phases vs trying to tackle the entire problem is a HUGE help to keeping sane. Even still, I have more things I'd like to add more to this project, but attempting one feature/ check at a time, helps you slowly build the final product.

### Day 11: December 10, 2018 - Monday
**Time Spent**: 3 hours

**Today's Work**:  
1. Bootcamp Prep - finished remaining videos, but haven't done all practice problems yet. Hopefully will finalize all of them tomorrow
2. Project - Clean up and further organize site.
3. Started working on my bootcamp application. Not really coding, but it's part of the path/plan to get me to be a better coder.
