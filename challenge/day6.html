			<h1>Date: Dec 5</h1>
			<p> Day 6</p>
			<p>I've been alternating between doing mini projects vs doing practice problems for the admissions test. As I've been doing more practice problems last few days, I've decided to tackle a mini project to completion today. It's not perfect, and I'm sure there are better ways for layout, etc; however, it works (at least from the testing I managed). 
			</p>
			<p>Maybe later this week, I can tackle on making these pages a bit more user/ reader friendly and clean up my CSS code some. I want to ensure the text doesn't run too long, add a side bar, make the pages mobile friend (they aren't right now as I write this. Hopefully as you read this some of these enhancements have been implemented) For now, this will do :).

			<h3> <i>Today's Project: Hangman</i> </h3>
		</section>

		<!--Introduction-->
		<section class="introduction">
			<p> The idea is well to recreate the classic game of hangman, where the user will input letters to guess the current word. The user must guess within 6 guesses before the stick figure gets hung</p>

		</section>

		<!--Steps Followed-->
		<section class= "steps">
			<h4>The Steps</h4>
			<p> These are the steps I took for my project:</p>
			<ol>
				<li> Created a very basic HTML file</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Added a Submit button that triggers a word to be selected when clicked</li>
					<li>Inserted word placeholder to show word length via blank indicators such as _ _ _ _ _</li>
					<li>Created an input field for user to enter guesses along with a submit button</li>
					<li><em>Note:</em> Both submit buttons trigger javascript functions </li>		
				</ul>
				<li> Wrote a corresponding js file to store functions</li>
				<li> Functions include: </li>
				<ul>
					<li>triggerWord()- which randomly selects a word from a list of 100 and returns a string of _ to indicate word length</li>
					<li>hangman()- which takes the user input, and determines if it is part of the word or not. If it is, it replaces the blank _ with the letter in the correct spot, otherwise, returns the incorrect letter along with incorrect count.</li>
					<li><em>Note: </em> If the user guesses the correct answer, returns a greeting + image. If runs out of guesses, returns try again next time!</li>
				</ul>
				<li> Had to add some checks in such as if the user submits blanks, invalid values (non-alpha), more than one letter, repeats a letter. Also I added image of hangman figure to replicate the true hangman experience</li>
			</ol>

		</section>

		<!--Lessons Learned-->
		<section class = "learned">
			<h4>The Lessons</h4>
			<ul>
				<li> Slowly getting better at using html and javascript together to make for a more interactive experience</li>
				<li> How to share alerts and errors if the input isn't valid. Probably here as well could minimize the amount of code used to implement checks, but again, saving that for another day</li>
				<li> How to pass variables between functions, and using global variables in order to ensure proper tracking of values as functions are ran multiple times</li>
				
			</ul>
			<p><em>To work on in the future:</em></p>
			<ul>
				<li> I'm sure I need to work on minimizing my code. Something that will hopefully come. For now I'm happy that it works :) </li>
				<li> Organizing my code better from the beginning. Spending more time on thinking each step through.</li>
			</ul>
