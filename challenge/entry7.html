For Yahtzeeee
- Click to hold dice
-Calculate score
- count rolls to 3

Lessons Learned:
 - when checking the class of an item, make sure it's not the child or parent. I was seeing if a span had a certain class name, but didn't realize it was on the parent div instead.
 - New functionalities used:
 	+ hasClass, removeClass, addClass - should I try toggle instead?
 	+ box shadow in css for the dice face
 	+ 

 Step 1: Create the dice face
 - Created 5 equal faces for the Yahtzee dice
 - Started with Numbers for now, maybe in future upgrade to actual dots on the dice
 - Center and align the dice


Step 2: Create random number values for the dice and hold functionality
 - Create function that randomly selects a number between 1-6 and places them on the dice face
 - make the dice faces clickable
 - if the face is clicked, change color of face to indicate it's selected. But also allow user to change mind and unclick face again
 - If a dice is 'held', ensure it doesn't change numbers (skip it from random number generation)


Step 3: Create "Roll" button and limit the number of rolls
- Give the user 3 rolls total per turn
- Once the user has 0 rolls left, don't allow to roll again


Step 4: Create score table and calculate score

step 5: Create new game button

Step 6: Create a rules button (use alert?)

Step 7: Make upgrades
- Add dots on the faces instead of numbers
- Have the dice "roll" via css animation
-
