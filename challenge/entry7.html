			<h1>Date: Dec 22</h1>
			<p>After spending the last few days enjoying some time with friends for the holidays, got cracking on a new project
			</p>

			<h3> <i>Today's Project: Yahtzeeee</i>
			</h3>
		</section>

		<!--Introduction-->
		<section class="introduction">
			<p> The idea behind this project is to be play Yahtzee. Given it's the holidays and the amount of features to be built in, this will definitely be a multi-day project. Happy holidays!</p>

		</section>
		<!--Steps Followed-->
		<section class= "steps">
			<h4>The Steps</h4>
			<p> Step 1: Create the dice face</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Created 5 equal faces for the Yahtzee dice</li>
				<li> Started with Numbers for now, maybe in future upgrade to actual dots on the dice. Started with dots but got stuck for now</li>
				<li> Center and align the dice</li>
			</ul>
			<p> Step 2: Create random number values for the dice and hold functionality</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Create function that randomly selects a number between 1-6 and places them on the dice face</li>
				<li> Make the dice faces clickable</li>
				<li> If the face is clicked, change color of face to indicate it's selected. But also allow user to change mind and unclick face again</li>
				<li> If a dice is 'held', ensure it doesn't change numbers (skip it from random number generation)</li>
			</ul>
			<p> Create "Roll" button and limit the number of rolls</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Give the user 3 rolls total per turn</li>
				<li> Once the user has 0 rolls left, don't allow to roll again</li>
			</ul>
			<p> Step 4: Create score table and calculate score</p>
			<ul>
				<li> This has been the most fun part ..ok the most challenging so in some ways more fun, and some ways not</li>
				<li> Had some issue with small Straight for some reason couldn't get my head around it. Not convinced I picked the easiest route, but that's ok. It works. </li>
				<li> Output various score options for each dice combinations</li>
				<li> Need to upgrade it still to allow storing of score</li>
			</ul>
			<p> Step 5: Future:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Create a new game button</li>
				<li> Create rues button (use alert?)</li>
				<li> Make upgrades</li>
				<ul>
					<li>add dots on the faces instead of numbers</li>
					<li>Have the dice "roll" via animation</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<!--Lessons Learned-->
		<section class = "learned">
			<h4>The Lessons</h4>
			<p> What I learned along the way:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> when checking the class of an item, make sure it's not the child or parent. I was seeing if a span had a certain class name, but didn't realize it was on the parent div instead.</li>
				<li>New functionalities used:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>hasClass, removeClass, addClass - should I try toggle instead?</li>
					<li>box shadow in css for the dice face </li>
				</ul>
			</ul>

<!-- For Yahtzeeee
- Click to hold dice
-Calculate score
- count rolls to 3

Lessons Learned:
 - when checking the class of an item, make sure it's not the child or parent. I was seeing if a span had a certain class name, but didn't realize it was on the parent div instead.
 - New functionalities used:
 	+ hasClass, removeClass, addClass - should I try toggle instead?
 	+ box shadow in css for the dice face
 	+ 

 Step 1: Create the dice face
 - Created 5 equal faces for the Yahtzee dice
 - Started with Numbers for now, maybe in future upgrade to actual dots on the dice
 - Center and align the dice


Step 2: Create random number values for the dice and hold functionality
 - Create function that randomly selects a number between 1-6 and places them on the dice face
 - make the dice faces clickable
 - if the face is clicked, change color of face to indicate it's selected. But also allow user to change mind and unclick face again
 - If a dice is 'held', ensure it doesn't change numbers (skip it from random number generation)


Step 3: Create "Roll" button and limit the number of rolls
- Give the user 3 rolls total per turn
- Once the user has 0 rolls left, don't allow to roll again


Step 4: Create score table and calculate score
- This has been the most fun part :S
- Had some issue with small Straight for some reason couldn't get my head around it. Not convinced I picked the easiest route, but that's ok. It works.
