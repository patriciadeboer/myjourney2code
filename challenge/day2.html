			<h1>Date: Nov 30</h1>
			<p> Today is the official first day of my coding challenge. So here we go.....</p>
			<p>My goal is starting today for the next 100 days to code something somewhere. They say the best way to learn is by practicing. So here goes nothing. Keep in mind, some days I may not do a project or build something on this site per se but I may practice via a coding site (i.e. codewars, or coderbyte), or watch some coding videos, etc. So that being said, I may not have a daily new project, but I do plan to write a journal entry sharing what I did each day, what challenges I faced, and overall what I learned or re-learned.

		<!--Introduction-->
		<section class="introduction">
			<p> The idea behind this project is for a circle to follow the mouses movement with a slight delay.</p>

		</section>

		<!--Steps Followed-->
		<section class= "steps">
			<h4>The Steps</h4>
			<p> These are the steps I took for my project:</p>
			<ol>
				<li> Signed into my GitHub Account (reset my password because let's be honest I didn't remember that...)</li>
				<li> On my computer under my user folder, I created a new folder called '100_days_of_Code'</li>
				<li>Next I opened 'Terminal'. I usually do this by hitting Command + 'space bar' then typing in 'Terminal'</li>
				<li>I went to said folder by typing 'cd 100_days_of_Code'</li>
				<li>Next I initialized the git process by typing 'git init'</li>
				<li>I got a message saying Initialized empty Git repository. From there I typed 'git status' just to check in</li>
				<li>I had no files in my folder, but then decided to add a readme.md file. I copied one from another project from before, updated it, and next up was adding it to git</li>
				<li>Next used git add to include in what I wanted to commit. I like to do all files (at least at this point in the project) so simply typed git add -A</li>
				<li> Next I committed the file(s) and added a comment of what the update was for, in this case adding the readme.md file so entered git commit -m 'Adding a readme.md file'</li> 
				<li> After getting confirmation of the commit, I was ready to push to the repository</li>

			</ol>
