			<h1>Date: Nov 30</h1>
			<p> Today is the official first day of my coding challenge. So here we go.....</p>
			<p>My goal is starting today for the next 100 days to code something somewhere. They say the best way to learn is by practicing. So here goes nothing. Keep in mind, some days I may not do a project or build something on this site per se but I may practice via a coding site (i.e. codewars, or coderbyte), or watch some coding videos, etc. So that being said, I may not have a daily new project, but I do plan to write a journal entry sharing what I did each day, what challenges I faced, and overall what I learned or re-learned.

			<h3> <i>Today's Project: Follow the Mouse</i>
			</h3>
		</section>

		<!--Introduction-->
		<section class="introduction">
			<p> The idea behind this project is for a circle to follow the mouses movement with a slight delay.</p>

		</section>

		<!--Steps Followed-->
		<section class= "steps">
			<h4>The Steps</h4>
			<p> These are the steps I took for my project:</p>
			<ol>
				<li> Created a very basic HTML file</li>
				<li> Added a css file but should combine it with my main one ... maybe tomorrow</li>
				<li> Created a ball figure and placed it in the top corner (for now)</li>
				<li> Created a js file to allow for following mouse movements</li>
				<li> Created a transition animation in CSS to delay the movement of the ball as it follows the mouse </li>
			</ol>

		</section>

		<!--Lessons Learned-->
		<section class = "learned">
			<h4>The Lessons</h4>
			<p> These are the steps I took for my project:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> How to use mouse movements and link it to a variable to allow for it to be used for coordinates of an object/div</li>
				
			</ul>
