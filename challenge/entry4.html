			<h1>Date: Dec 10</h1>
			<p>Put together a basic tic tac toe game to play vs the computer. 
			</p>

			<h3> <i>Today's Project: Tic Tac Toe</i>
			</h3>
		</section>

		<!--Introduction-->
		<section class="introduction">
			<p> The idea behind this project is a user can select a box to put a X and then the computer will respond with a O. As of right now, it doesn't stop when you hit 3 in a row</p>

		</section>
		<!--Steps Followed-->
		<section class= "steps">
			<h4>The Steps</h4>
			<ul>
				<li> Create basic css grid for the tic tac toe box</li>
				<li> Create a JS file that slowly goes through each of the following:</li>
				<ol>
					<li> First have it so that once a box is selected, an X appears from the user</li>
					<li> Trigger a computer turn function that randomly selects a box and inserts a O</li>
					<li> Next start implementing checks.</li>
					<ul>
						<li> If the user selects a filled box, alert user.</li>
						<li> If computer selects filled box, make the function choose another</li>
					</ul>
					<li> Things still want to add:</li>
					<ul>
						<li> Right now, the computer is randomly selecting a box, ideally it should be trying to block any multiple boxes in a row, but alas, I will save that for a future date :)</li>
						<li> Choice to play with friend vs play with computer</li>
						<li>Adding highlight of winning row once 3 in a row is in play </li>

					</ul>

			<p> What I learned along the way:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> make sure you have the right js file linked :)</li>
				<li>New functionalities used:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>using 'this' in js to identify the current selected box</li>

<!-- 
 Lessons Learned:
 - make sure you have the right js file linked :)
 - New functionalities used:
 	+ using 'this' in js to identify the current selected box
 	+ using ability to append within the box via javascript
 	+ 

 Steps: 
 - Create basic css grid for the tic tac toe box
 - create a JS file that slowly goes through each functionality
 1) First have it so that once a box is selected, an X appears from the user
 2) Trigger a computer turn function
 	- Randomly selects a box and inserts a O
 3) Next start implementing checks. 
 	- If the user selects a filled box, alert user.
 	- If computer selects filled box, make the function choose another
 4) Start seeing if there are 3 in a row -if so, declare a winner
 5) In future,
 	-Right now, the computer is randomly selecting a box, ideally it should be trying to block any multiple boxes in a row, but alas, I will save that for a future date :)
 	- Choice to play with friend vs play with computer
 	- Adding highlight of winning row once 3 in a row is in play -->
