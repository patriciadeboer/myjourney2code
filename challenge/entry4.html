Lessons Learned:
 - make sure you have the right js file linked :)
 - New functionalities used:
 	+ using 'this' in js to identify the current selected box
 	+ using ability to append within the box via javascript
 	+ 

 Steps: First create the grid
 - Create basic css
 - create a JS file that slowly goes through each functionality
 1) First have it so that once a box is selected, an X appears from the user
 2) Trigger a computer turn function
 	- Randomly selects a box and inserts a O
 3) Next start implementing checks. 
 	- If the user selects a filled box, alert user.
 	- If computer selects filled box, make the function choose another
 4) Start seeing if there are 3 in a row -if so, declare a winner
 5) In future,
 	-Right now, the computer is randomly selecting a box, ideally it should be trying to block any multiple boxes in a row, but alas, I will save that for a future date :)
 	- Choice to play with friend vs play with computer
