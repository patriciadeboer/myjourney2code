# A website made to track my coding process as I learn to code. 

*********************************

Starting November 24, I will take the 100 Days of Code challenge. This is where I'll store my progress. Until then I will take a few online courses to get familiar with coding again. By the end of the year, I hope to apply to coding school. Fingers cross I get in!

Name: Patricia de Boer

Still trying to get the hang of GitHub, but alas, practice makes perfect! It's been a few years since I've used it.

*********************************

Over the course of my coding experience, I expect the layout of this site to change. I will take weekly snapshots of the site to show the changes as we move through pieces. I will try to keep a journal entry for each change in the site. I may not be able to update that daily but the goal is to have some new designs daily to practice my coding and improve it on a daily basis.

WISH ME LUCK!
