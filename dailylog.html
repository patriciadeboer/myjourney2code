<!-- # 100 Days Of Code - Daily Log -->


<h1> Day 1: November 30, 2018 - Friday</h1>
<em>Time Spent:</em> 2hrs

<h3>Today's Work</h3>: Made a very basic animation. Just something to get this challenge started. I played with some formatting as well. Some of the base of the site I had started building before starting the challenge. 

<h3>Thoughts</h3>: Tomorrow I hope to go back and clean up some of my base code for the site, as I want to make sure things don't go out of hand quickly.

### Day 2: December 1, 2018 - Saturday
**Time Spent**: 1.5 hrs

**Today's Work**: Today I just focused on doing a few practice exercises and watch Fullstack Bootcamp prep videos. I got through all the Object videos on the Bootcamp prep course, and went through about 5 coderbyte challenges. Came across some hurdles, but overall making progress. I did the following challenges: 
+  Array Addition I
+  Second GreatLow
+  Word Count
+  Prime Time
+  Number Addition

**Thoughts**: Learned some useful new methods. One that I learned to use and that saved me a lot of time was match(). In the number addition problem, you had to search for the numbers within a string. var nums = str.match(/[0-9]+/gi) || [0]; I returns all the matches in an array. By adding the '+' you say combine any consecutive matches in one value within the array. So 89forever3yours. It would return [89,3]. Can be very useful to remember!

### Day 6: December 5, 2018 - Wednesday
**Time Spent**: 4 hours

**Today's Work**:  
1. Practice Problems on Coderbyte:
  + None yet
2. Project - Hangman. I created a basic version of hangman on my site today. It picks from a list of 100 random words and takes input from the user to see if it's a match. The user has 6 wrong attempts before their chances are up. If you want to try to play, check out the project link below. 

**Thoughts**: Realize I need to think more about the structure of my site and the importance of organization. I may want to use of my days this week to try to clean up the site some, streamline the code, and make the site mobile friendly before I get too far in. 
Did help me to do a lot of JS + HTML stuff today. Remembering how the functions in javascript can help make the HTML and CSS more interactive and dynamic. It was fun, yet frustrating at times. Check on the project for yourself!
