Today I'm setting up the basics

1st I set up the file structure
<screen shot of folders>

I had to do a few things. Get the normalize.css file by googling it. Just search normalize .css file in google. Add it to the folder structure

Start with the index file for your home screen. I want to put a nice large picture on this page with a bold text. I will start with the text and then add the image secondly. After adding my basic sections in my html --> Head, Body and creating sections. I put some basic headers in. this is the file alone with no formatting.
<html basic file img>
<index html file basic img>
